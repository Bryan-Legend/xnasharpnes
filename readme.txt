This is a conversion of Sharpnes by Jonathan Turner.  Converting it only took
a couple of hours.  http://jturner.tapetrade.net/sharpnes/index.html

It runs at 60% or 70% of normal speed on the 360, so it's playable but slow.
There's probably some very easy optimizations and cleanups to be done still.

Right now there is no rom loading menu, so to switch roms you have to include
the rom in the SharpNES360 project and set it to "Copy to Output Directory",
then edit the filename in Program.cs.

This requires a creators club account which runs $99 a year or $49 for four
months.  You'll also need Visual C# Studio Express which is free.
